# 🎓 C++ University Projects

Welcome to my collection of **C++ university projects** — practical implementations of data structures and object-oriented principles.

Each folder contains a specific task and the corresponding class implementation.

---

## 📁 Folder Overview

- `class array` — Custom implementation of a dynamic array
- `class matrix` — Matrix class with basic operations
- `class shared_ptr` — Smart pointer implementation (like `std::shared_ptr`)
- `class unordered_set` — Hash set structure with insertion & lookup
- `class vector` — Custom vector class mimicking `std::vector`
- `shapes` — Polymorphic shape hierarchy (e.g. circle, square, etc.)

## 🚀 Technologies
- Language: **C++**
- Concepts: **Classes**, **Inheritance**, **Templates**, **Smart Pointers**
- Build system: CMake (recommended)

## 📚 Purpose
These assignments were completed as part of coursework at university and serve to demonstrate:
- Understanding of low-level memory management
- Implementation of STL-like classes from scratch
- Application of OOP principles in C++
